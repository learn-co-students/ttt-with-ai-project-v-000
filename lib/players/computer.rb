# Win: If you have two in a row, play the third to get three in a row.
#Block: If the opponent has two in a row, play the third to block them.
#Fork: Create an opportunity where you can win in two ways.
#Block Opponent's Fork:
#Option 1: Create two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as
# it doesn't result in them creating a fork or winning. For example, if "X" has
#a corner, "O" has the center, and "X" has the opposite corner as well, "O" must
# not play a corner in order to win. (Playing a corner in this scenario creates
#a fork for "X" to win.)

#Option 2: If there is a configuration where the opponent can fork, block that fork.
#Center: Play the center.
#Opposite Corner: If the opponent is in the corner, play the opposite corner.
#Empty Corner: Play an empty corner.
#Empty Side: Play an empty side.
