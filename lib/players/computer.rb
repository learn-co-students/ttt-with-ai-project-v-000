I think to refine the code a little bit we should get rid of the if self.token
I know we planned out to use it originally, but I think instead we should start
structure the code as follows. Kep in mind that I am just trying to show strucure
because I am not positive I understand your code. For example I don't see your
game.can_win method.

@currrent_move_count = 0
if @current_move_count  >= 2 $$ game.can_win?
	move = move_block_win
elsif @current_move_count ==0 $$ board.center[0] = ""
	move = board.center[0]
elsif @current_move_count == 0
	take corner (not entering value until I go over with you)
elsif @current_move_count == 1 ... so on and so forth. I didn't want to fill out
the code because I am not quite sure thai I won't mess up your algo.

#notes 2,1--> everything should working including last_turn_corner. Move diagonal corner keeps causing infinite loops.
But the values within that method all show correctly. Still working it.
