    # These arrays contain the patterns of board states that require specific
    # responses to defend against and attack, or to counter-attack against a
    # misplay. The Ints are used to do array comparissons, while the Strings are
    # used as the appropriate reaction to that pattern.
    #
    # Because the board is a 3x3 square, a lot of the patterns are actually the
    # same only rotated. A future version of this AI would probably benefit from
    # a method that can flip and rotate the board to match patters and require
    # less procedurally guided logic.
    #
    # Lastly, while there are offensive punishes and a 50/50 chance for X to
    # initiate and edge_attack if the board state is correct, the AI doesn't
    # have a way of determining what the best non-reactive play is in order to
    # try and win. This most likely only costs a few games against the RNG AI,
    # and programming the AI to understand what the best move is based on
    # available lines of play later seems like a task for future Nikolai.
