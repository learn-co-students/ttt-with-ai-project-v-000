##### `game.rb` - `Game`
#The `Game` class is the main model of the application and represents a singular instance of a Tic-tac-toe session.

#  * A game has one `Board` through its `board` property.
#  * A game has two `Player`s stored in a `player_1` and `player_2` property.

#`Board` and `Player` do not directly relate to the `Game` but do collaborate with each other through arguments.

#Beyond providing relationships with players and a board, the `Game` instance must also provide the basic game runtime
#and logic. These methods relate to the state of the game such as `#current_player`, `#won?`, and `#winner`. The other
#methods relate to managing a game, like `#start`, `#play`, and `#turn`. The test suite describes the method requirements.
