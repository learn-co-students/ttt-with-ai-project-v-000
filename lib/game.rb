#The Game class is the main model of the application and represents a singular instance of a Tic-tac-toe session.
  #A game has one Board through its board property.
  #A game has two Players stored in a player_1 and player_2 property.
#Board and Player do not directly relate to the Game but do collaborate with each other through arguments.

#Beyond providing relationships with players and a board, the Game instance must also provide the basic game runtime and logic. These methods relate to the state of the game such as #current_player, #won?, and #winner. The other methods relate to managing a game, like #start, #play, and #turn. The test suite describes the method requirements.
