(Points 3 & 4 from the wikipedia strategy have not been implemented) <br />

<ul>
<lh><u> Applied in this order - </u></lh>
<li><b>Win:</b> If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row. </li>
<li><b>Block:</b> If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.</li>
<li><b>Center:</b> A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing on a corner gives "O" more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)</li>
<li><b>Opposite corner:</b> If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.</li>
<li><b>Empty corner:</b> The player plays in a corner square.</li>
<li><b>Empty side:</b> The player plays in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.</li>
</ul>
