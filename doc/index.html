<h2 id="label-Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to build a version of Tic Tac Toe with 0, 1,
and 2 player modes. What is the point of Tic Tac Toe with zero players? Let
me explain more.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>A 0 player game has two computer players playing against each other with no
interaction from the user.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A 1 player game has a human playing against a computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A 2 player game has two human players.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>You&#39;ll be implementing Tic Tac Toe using multiple objects that relate
and collaborate, including separate classes for Human players and Computer
players. The computer player class will have some sort of artificial
intelligence or logic to make move decisions. Finally, you&#39;ll wrap all
of this up in a Command Line Interface.</p>

<h3 id="label-Some+Hints+on+Working+Together">Some Hints on Working Together</h3>

<p>Working on a software project with another person is not something to be
taken lightly. While you are a fantastic coder solo, software development
is a collaborative activity. Just like anything else, there is skill in
collaborating on code. In the end, collaborating with another person boils
down to three different styles:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Pair - Pair the entire time working linearly together</p>
</li><li>
<p>Pass - Each person completes 1 requirement and then passes the project to
the other person</p>
</li><li>
<p>Parallel - work on different parts at the same time by agreeing on
interfaces and stubs and meeting in the middle</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Person A codes the board and the human player class</p>
</li><li>
<p>Person B creates the game engine, expecting a working board and player with
stubs</p>
</li><li>
<p>Person A creates the computer player</p>
</li><li>
<p>Work together on the AI (It&#39;s hard)</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>Remember! The goal at The Flatiron School is not to do, it is to
<em>learn</em>. Make sure you have worked in all three styles of
collaboration. We want you to learn how the different styles works, and
make sure that together you and your partner understand every part of the
code.</p>

<h4 id="label-Gemfile+and+config-2Fenvironment.rb"><code>Gemfile</code> and <code>config/environment.rb</code></h4>

<p>This project is supported by Bundler and includes a <code>Gemfile</code>.</p>

<p>Run <code>bundle install</code> before getting started on the project.</p>

<p>As this project has quite a few files, an <code>environment.rb</code> is
included that loads all the code in your project along with Bundler. You do
not ever need to edit this file. When you see <code>require_relative
&#39;../config/environment&#39;</code>, as in <code>bin/tictactoe</code>,
that is how your environment and code are loaded.</p>

<h4 id="label-lib+-+Tic+Tac+Toe+Models"><code>lib</code> - Tic Tac Toe Models</h4>

<p>You will be implementing Tic Tac Toe through a domain model that uses
multiple classes to encapsulate the different logical components and units
in Tic Tac Toe.</p>

<h5 id="label-board.rb+-+Board"><code>board.rb</code> - <code>Board</code></h5>

<p>The <code>Board</code> class represents the data and logic of a Tic Tac Toe
game board. It has a property, <code>cells</code>, that stores the data of
the state of the board in an array. The <code>#reset!</code> method can
reset the state of the cells to what a board should look like at the start
of a game, an array with 9 <code>&quot; &quot;</code> elements.</p>

<p>When a board is initialized, it should start with cells for a new game of
Tic Tac Toe. You can and should use <code>#reset!</code>.</p>

<p>A board can print its current state with the <code>#display</code> method.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll also build a <code>#position</code> method that takes in the
user&#39;s input in the form of 1-9 strings like “2” or “9” and looks up
the value of the cells at the correct index from the array&#39;s
perspective. All other methods will take input in the user&#39;s
perspective of 1-9 strings and use <code>#position</code> to look up the
value according to the cells&#39; array index.</p>

<p>Similarly, you&#39;re going to build an <code>#update</code> method that
represents updating the board when a player makes a move. This method will
take two arguments, the first will be the position the user wants to occupy
in the form of 1-9 strings that you will need to convert to the board
cells&#39; array index, along with the player object making the move. When
you update the appropriate index in the cells, you will set it equal to the
token of the player object by calling the <code>#token</code> method on the
player.</p>

<p>Finally, a board can return values based on its state such as
<code>#full?</code> when entirely occupied with “X” and “O”s and a
<code>#turn_count</code> based on how many positions in the cells array are
filled. <code>#taken?</code> will return true or false for an individual
position. <code>#valid_move?</code> will ensure that moves are between 1-9
and not taken.</p>

<h5 id="label-player.rb+-+Player"><code>player.rb</code> - <code>Player</code></h5>

<p>The <code>Player</code> class is not actually a valid player of Tic Tac Toe
but rather a root class that will act as an inheritance point for actual
player classes such as <code>Human &lt; Player</code> and <code>Computer
&lt; Player</code>. The <code>Player</code> root class will define only the
most basic properties of a player, that they have a <code>token</code>
property that can be set upon initialization.</p>

<p>Every player subclass will implement a <code>#move</code> method that
represents how that type of player makes a move in Tic Tac Toe.</p>

<h5 id="label-27players-2Fhuman.rb-27+-+Players-3A-3AHuman">&#39;players/human.rb&#39; - <code>Players::Human</code></h5>

<p>Define a class <code>Human</code> that inherits from <code>Player</code>.
This class should be namespaced inside the module <code>Players</code>
because the <code>human.rb</code> file is inside the <code>players/</code>
directory. This keeps our code nice and tidy.</p>

<p>The human player must implement a <code>#move</code> method that takes in a
<code>board</code> argument and allows a human player to enter a move via
the CLI. The method should return the value the user enters. Even though
the method accepts a <code>board</code> argument, it does not need to use
it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note on name spacing: You&#39;ll notice here that we do
<code>Players::Human &lt; Player</code> does not work because the
<code>Players</code> module is not yet defined. So to do this, we&#39;ll
need to do: <code>ruby module Players   class Human &lt; Player     # your
code here   end end </code> Now when you call your Human class, you&#39;ll
have to call it inside its name space with <code>Players::Human</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="label-game.rb+-+Game"><code>game.rb</code> - <code>Game</code></h5>

<p>The <code>Game</code> class is the main model of the application and
represents a singular instance of a Tic Tac Toe session.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>A game has one <code>Board</code> through its <code>board</code> property.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A game has two <code>Player</code>s stored in a <code>player_1</code> and
<code>player_2</code> property.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><code>Board</code> and <code>Player</code> do not directly relate to the
<code>Game</code> but do collaborate with each other through arguments.</p>

<p>Beyond providing relationships with players and a board, the
<code>Game</code> instance must also provide the basic game runtime and
logic. These methods relate to the state of the game such as
<code>#current_player</code>, <code>#won?</code>, and <code>#winner</code>.
The other methods relate to managing a game, like <code>#start</code>,
<code>#play</code>, and <code>#turn</code>. The test suite describes the
method requirements.</p>

<h5 id="label-27players-2Fcomputer.rb-27+-+Players-3A-3AComputer">&#39;players/computer.rb&#39; - <code>Players::Computer</code></h5>

<p>Define a class <code>Players::Computer</code> that represents a computer
player of Tic Tac Toe. Implement a <code>#move</code> method that accepts a
board and returns the move the computer wants to make in the form of a 1-9
string. How the computer decides to make that move is up to you but it must
be capable of returning a valid move at some point.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='kw'>def</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_move'>move</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_board'>board</span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
  <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&quot;</span><span class='tstring_content'>1</span><span class='tstring_end'>&quot;</span></span>
<span class='kw'>end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Returns a valid move for the first move but after that your program will go
into an infinite loop because the computer will constantly try to occupy
the <code>&quot;1&quot;</code> position in the board even though it is
already occupied. So don&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>Think about the levels of intelligence you can build into this method.
Start with the simplest level of intelligence, and get more and more
complicated. Each step of the way you should have a working computer player
though.</p>

<p>Remember, Tic Tac Toe when played perfectly is unwinnable. You should
strive to build computer logic that when the computer plays, the game is
unwinnable. You can hardcode your logic, things like “On turn 1 always try
to go in the middle if you can” and if not “try to go in a corner” or any
logic tree you can think of - there is an algorithm called Min/Max, but
it&#39;s going to be hard to implement given our current implementation of
a Game, so we recommend building something that&#39;s a more colloquial or
condition-based algorithm.</p>

<h4 id="label-bin-2Ftictactoe"><code>bin/tictactoe</code></h4>

<p>The requirements of your CLI are as follows, free for you to implement
however you see fit as we provide no tests against the CLI.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Greet the user with a message.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Prompt the user for what kind of game they want to play, 0,1, or 2 player.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ask the user for who should go first and be “X”.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use the input to correctly initialize a <code>Game</code> with the
appropriate player types and token values.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the game is over, the CLI should prompt the user if they would like to
play again and allow them to choose a new configuration for the game as
described above. If the user doesn&#39;t want to play again, exit the
program.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>You can implement this logic within the <code>bin/tictactoe</code> directly
or encapsulate it within <code>Game</code> via a method like
<code>#start</code> and simply evoke that method in the CLI. There is no
wrong way to implement code that works.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like, implement a “wargames” game type. When asked what kind
of game they want to play or for the number of players, if the user types
in “wargames”, have the computer play itself 100 times and report how many
times the game was won. This is not a requirement, it would just be fun. A
perfect computer AI should never be able to win, like in the case of
thermonuclear war.</p>

<p>The rest is up to you and your team. Have fun, implement the spirit of the
project, meet the requirements as you interpret them, be creative, and
don&#39;t worry, there are no wrong answers with code.</p>
