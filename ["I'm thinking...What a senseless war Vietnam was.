 "I'm thinking... It seems like the better technology gets, the more miserable people become(-Louis C.K.). (The rest is not Louis C.K.)My iphone headphones don't have a wire so I'm going to lose them. I lose everthing that's not physically connected to something else. And they're so expensive to replace and I paid $500 for this phone phone this phone(Yes I saw the egregious typo there, but I'm not gonna fix it. You know why? Because what are you gonna do about it?) even though my old one was just a year old and perfectly fine. I hate Apple, I hate life. The next iphone better have strings attached, otherwise, I'm not sure how many more years I'm going to camp out in line for a new phone",
 "I'm thinking...humans are weird. Some humans
  are sure the earth is 6000 years old. Other humans, who have studied things and read a lot of books say they have proven it is 4 million years old. And some humans still laugh at Adam Sandler movies.",
 "I'm thinking...ask a Trump supporter how they Justify supporting a man who has promised many times at many locations and all of them recorded with video and audio, that he will try to take away our most basic feedoms, except the freedom to own guns. Ask them why they hate the constitution so much that they are going to vote for a man who promises to shred the document and the rights guaranteed therein...They don't have an answer...ever",

 "I'm thinking...a job in sales would be pretty cool, because every single day you get to go to an office, work your ass off and get rejected all day long just praying for that one ‘yes.’
However, you get to go home everyday knowing that you’ve done an honest day’s work, that you tried your best and you are wrapped in the warm comfy blanket of knowledge that you are another day closer to death.”,
 "I'm thinking...If Smokey the Bear is right and I truly am the only one who can prevent forest fires, then those forests and the people who dwell in them are in some seriously deep shit. Because there is very little I can do to prevent a fire. If I'm the the only thing standing between a forest and total desruction, I gotta say that would be a veritable orgasm of poor planning",
 "I'm thinking...Cocaine explains the last 17 years of Donald Trump's life perfectly. It would all make sense, especially the campaign", I'm thinking...that most sins have a punishment that in no way fits the crime. Like if my neighbor has a hot wife and I covet her for a just few minutes when I'm alone now and again, that's sin. Or just telling a small little lie on a first date like, sure I want to have kids, that's sin! The punishment for having sin on your soul when you die? fucking eternity!. For...Ever! pain and suffering and agony beyond beief ForEver!! What the hell is eternity about? That's way too long and does not fit a small little lie.

Your future humans will refer to this period as a sort of mini dark ages. Even though we are seeing rapid advancements in technology, American citizens are moving backwards in the perception of the world and they value ignorance over knowledge. They look down on intelligence and they nominated and almost elected Donald Trump, whose brain was analyzed after his death caused by cheeto choking, which is exactly what it sounds like, and found to contain bubbles. That's right Trump's brain turned out to consist mainly of air bubbles. But out of those air bubbles would sometimes come hundreds of little tiny scrolls. And on those scolls were printed "The best words. So he really did, in fact, have words, and they were the best words.", "I'm thinking...The movie 'Crash' that won Sandra Bullock an Oscar for playing  a white lady who single handedly solved the problem of racism in the world was so bad with a stupidity level not achieved since the 'Earnest' movies.
