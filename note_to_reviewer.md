Hello, Flatiron instructor!

I worked together with Yvonne (@sidhe-is-me) but I couldn't add her on the lab page on Learn.co.
On AAQ, another instructor suggested I do a hard reset and keep trying, but no dice.
Anyway, I think she was able to add me on her end, but just wanted to let you know.

Enjoy! (?)
