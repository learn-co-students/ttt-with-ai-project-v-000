#The requirements of your CLI are as follows...

#Greet the user with a message.
#Prompt the user for what kind of game they want to play, 0,1, or 2 player.
#Ask the user for who should go first and be "X".
#Use the input to correctly initialize a Game with the appropriate player types and token values.
#When the game is over, the CLI should prompt the user if they would like to play again and allow them to
#choose a new configuration for the game as described above. If the user doesn't want to play again, exit the program.
#You can implement this logic within the bin/tictactoe directly or encapsulate it within Game via a method
#like #start and simply evoke that method in the CLI. There is no wrong way to implement code that works
