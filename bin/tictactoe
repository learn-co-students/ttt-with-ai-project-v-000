####Greet the user with a message.
puts "Welcome to Julie & Mel's Tic Tac Toe"

####Prompt the user for what kind of game they want to play, 0,1, or 2 player.
puts "How many players: 0, 1, or 2?"
#need conditional that assigns input as Computer/Computer, Human/Human, or Human/Computer players

####Ask the user for who should go first and be "X".
puts "Who should go first?"


####Use the input to correctly initialize a Game with the appropriate player types and token values.
new_game = Game.new#(players go in here?)
until game.over?
  game.play
end

####When the game is over, the CLI should prompt the user if they would like to play again and allow them to choose a new configuration for the game as described above. If the user doesn't want to play again, exit the program
puts "Would you like to play again?"
#this potential loop makes me think we should encapsulate the new game questions in its own class, instead of here
