#Note to reviewers: I've looked at other codes (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop) and realize that this example isn't anywhere near what is possible. I've chosen to end it here, flaws and all, because I'm eager to move forward. There's so much I want to learn and I'm certain that I now have the tools to do a project like this in the future --with much better logic & coding. Cheers!
