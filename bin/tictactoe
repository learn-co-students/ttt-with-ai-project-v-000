# working on game.start method:
#  |_  problem seems to be that when selecting type of game the case...when
#  |_  statments are not working properly and assigning @player_1 and @player_2
#  |_ values accordingly, thus Game.self shows default @player_1 and @player_2 #  |_ values from instantiation
# 0-player & 1-player games not working so far
# 2-player game wasn't working when selecting position#9, but fixed now
#   |_ position#9 issue: my board.valid_move? method used (1...9).include? but should have been (1..9) to include 9 in the range.
#   |__should work now but not yet tested
