# working on game.start method:
# problem seems to be that when selecting type of game the case...when
#     statments are not working properly and assigning @player_1 and @player_2 values accordingly, thus Game.self shows default @player_1 and @player_2 values from instantiation
# 0-player & 1-player games not working so far
# 2-player game wasn't working when selecting position#9, but fixed now
#     |__should work now but not yet tested
