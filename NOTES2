Method 1:
Winning or Drawing when Playing First

1. Play your first X in a corner.
-   a corner when they get to play first.
- If your opponent responds by putting an O anywhere besides the center, you can guarantee a win
(1. x in corner)
(2. opponent NEEDS/MUST to put o in center -  If your opponent plays her first O in the center,
you have to wait for her to make a mistake before you can )

2. Try to win if your opponent plays the first O in the center.
- Place your second X in the opposite corner from your first, so there's a line going "X O X"
  - if
    user responds with o in one of the other corners you can win!!!
  - place your x in the last empty corner
  - then
    your opponent won't win!!!
   - or -
- Place your second X on an edge square (not a corner), not touching your first X.
  - if [ your opponent puts down an O in
    the corner that's not next to your X,
    - you can use your third X
    to block her move and automatically
    win with your fourth X.  ]

3. Win automatically if your opponent plays his first O in any square besides the center.
(- if opponent puts his first o in any square besides
the center you can win!!!)
- Respond by putting your second x in any other corner, with
an empty spa_____ce in between the two X's

4. Place your third X so you have two possible winning moves.
- ex. x o _
      o _ _
      x _ (x)
    - If their is empty square in line with both your first and Second
    x with no enemy blocking that line. PUT YOUR X IN THIS SQURE!!

5. Win with your fourth X.
  s into one of them.
  Since your opponent can only make one move,
  he can only block one of those squares.
  Write your fourth X into the square he didn't block,
  and you've won the game!






  
Method 2:
Never Losing when Playing Second

1. Force a draw if the opponent starts in the corner.
2. Force a draw when the opponent starts in the center.
3. Try to win if the opponent starts at the edge.
